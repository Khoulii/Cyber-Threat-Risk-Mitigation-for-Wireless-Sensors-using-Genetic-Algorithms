# Cyber-Threat-Risk-Mitigation-for-Wireless-Sensors-using-Genetic-Algorithms
The purpose of this project is to study different types of network attacks and their effects on system performance, particularly in terms of energy consumption and response time.

## The Dataset
The dataset has been extratced from the paper "WSN-BFSF: A New Dataset for Attacks Detection in Wireless Sensor Networks", where it was obtained from a simulation and was made ready to be examined with learning models after the necessary preprocessing.

## Descriptive Analytics
First, I have analyzed the dataset, derived from network traffic simulations, to identify patterns associated with different types of network attacks, such as Blackhole, Flooding, and Selective 
Forwarding, using data analytics tools and techniques to derive actionable insights from raw network traffic data.
